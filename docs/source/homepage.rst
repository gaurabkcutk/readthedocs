User can also serach for any specific experiments using the search functionality. This is a free form search with auto complete. 
The experiments can be sorted by available option in both ascending and descending order.
Advanced search capability is also available. For example looking for specific user and machine combination, we can do:

.. code-block:: console

    user:gaurab machine:summit

More than one search can also be performed at a time by using pipe (|) for search queries. For example looking for experiments by 2 different users, we can do:

.. code-block:: console

    user:gaurab | user:sarat

If you are looking for a exact match prepend '$' keyword to your search query.
More details about advanced search can be found `here <https://pace.ornl.gov/searchTips/>`_ .

Another capability available is a summary scatter plot. Click on the 'Scatter Plot' button on top right. This will display a scatter graph.
The summary can be displayed for Machine, User, Compset and Res. To view for specific experiments, click on labels on top of graph which will hide/show that data point.
Use labels to filter further down to your interest.
