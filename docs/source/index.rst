Performance Analytics for Computational Experiments (PACE)
===================================

Understanding computational performance of a complex coupled model like the 
`Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) <https://e3sm.org/>`_ 
poses a singular challenge to domain and computational scientists. Toward that goal, we developed 
`PACE (Performance Analytics for Computational Experiments) <https://pace.ornl.gov/>`_
, a web-enabled framework to summarize performance data collected from E3SM experiments to derive insights and present them through a web portal.

The primary goal of PACE is to serve as a central hub of performance data to provide an executive summary of E3SM experiment performance.
