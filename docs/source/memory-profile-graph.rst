Memory Usage Profile
----------------

A recent version of E3SM master includes an improvement in our memory usage profiling. This page shows how to use it to check for possible 
memory leaks and out-of-memory type of issues.


Memory usage is captured at a node-level for each of 9 ROOTPE component nodes (CPL, ATM, LND, ICE, OCN, GLC, ROF, WAV, IAC) once-a-day
Memory usage is represented by a pair of "highwater" and "usage" numbers. The highwater number represents a total memory footprint of
a process including data paged out to disk (virtual memory) and the usage number represents memory actually residing in RAM (resident set size).
Per-task memory snapshots are summed up across all tasks on a node to derive on-node memory highwater and memory usage in megabytes.

Both Resident and Virtual memory profiling graph is displayed. Click on labels to filter the PE component for your desire view.
