Special thanks to Patrick H. Worley for incorporating the timing infrastructure and performance archiving capabilities in E3SM which paved the way for PACE.

This research was supported as part of the E3SM project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Science, Office of Biological and Environmental Research. The students' work was partially supported by an appointment to the Science Education and Workforce Development Programs at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, administered by ORISE through the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education. This research used resources of the Compute and Data Environment for Science (CADES) at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, which is supported by the Office of Science of the U.S. Department of Energy under Contract No. DE-AC05-00OR22725.

Thanks to Aaron Donahue and Peter Caldwell for sharing their process layout and atmosphere sub-component timing scripts.
